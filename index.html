                    <p style="width:80%; margin: auto;">Resilience and mental well-being is an important part of a
                        personâ€™s health and
                        overall
                        development.
                        In the 2018 Youth Conversation Poll, mental and emotional well-being was one of the top issues
                        our
                        youths are concerned about. <br> When youths are feeling very lost in life and on the verge of
                        breaking down, they would want someone to advise them on how to cope with their mental distress.
                        Youths also feel helpless as they do not know of appropriate ways to help their friends in
                        distress.
                        Many are also reluctant to share their problems with their friends for fear of being judged
                        and current platforms for youths do not really give good advice on mental wellness. </p>
