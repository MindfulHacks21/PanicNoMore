# Panic! No more 
## What is it about
Panic! No more is a project we created with the goal to educate and empower individuals to take responsibility for their own mental health and wellness, and to encourage them to practice mindfulness in the long term.

## How was it created
It is built with the use of HTML/CSS and Javascript, particularly with the use of the pixiJS library for some cool animations in the interactive game.

## What's next for Panic! No more 
* Hope to be able to use as a platform for students to better prepare and equip themselves with knowledge of mental health, to help themselves and others.
* Gamified Learning Scenarios - Expansion of the possible scenarios to reach more than just situations faced due to academic stress, but also venture into the field of relationship issues, family pressure as well as adulting stress.
